## Bibliography of AI Portfolios

This repository contains influential references used in all the AI portfolio submissions for
"IE 694: Industrial Applications of Artificial Intelligence" coursework
that inspired and majorly governed the theoretical and practical portfolio submissions.

Additionally, we also provide the corresponding latex, assets and pdf artifact files for further easing out reference work progress.
Also, in below sections the corresponding links for practical work associated with the portfolios are also provided.
